  <p><em>ABOUT ME:</em> I hail from the artic, born in Fairbanks, Alaska, and spent my early years under the aurora borealis. I loved the cold majestic beauty of the last frontier and am so thankful for the resiliance and strength that that envoirment brought. After high school I moved to Portland, Oregon and got BA degree in Health Sciences. I have spent the last 5 years working in healthcare as an operations manager, but realized that it was time for me to make a career change and explore something new. I am thrilled to be entering the software development world and to learn about all the creative ways that you can share content with the world. </p>

  <p><em>PERSONAL INTERESTS:</em></p>
    <ul> 
      <li>I aim to be the puzzle master. Whether it be the daily Sudoku, Wordle, or even a good old fashioned 1000 peice jigsaw puzzle, I just can't get enough of them! Check out my favorite sudoku app <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/sudoku/hard">here</a>.</li>
      <li>And if I'm not knee deep in a puzzle then you can find me making cakes or drumming up elaborate cocktails to share with friends.</li>
    </ul>
